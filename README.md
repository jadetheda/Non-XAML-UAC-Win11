This isn't really mine but 
- The latest version available at https://aubymori.github.io/#!/files/classic-uac is broken for Windows 11, and shows and error when you try to elevate
  
- The old version linked at https://web.archive.org/web/20240223150635/https://winclassic.net/thread/1778/non-xaml-uac-back
  - used an expired Discord attachment link, requiring you to send the link the in a server to refresh it,
  - doesn't have the automatic installer the new version has.
 
So, I just replaced the resources in the new version with those from the old version (most importantly the compatible consent.exe), letting you easily download and install this on Windows 11, even 24H2!

P.S. 
GitHub 'fixed' the line endings on some of these dlls, and while that shouldn't affect anything, I have not independently verified this.
